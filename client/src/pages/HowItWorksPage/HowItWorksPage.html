                <h1>How Does Squadhelp Work?</h1>
                <p>Squadhelp allows you to host branding competitions to engage with the most creative
                    people across the globe and get high-quality results, fast. Thousands of creatives
                    compete with each other, suggesting great name ideas. At the end of the
                    collaborative contest, you select one winner. The winner gets paid, and you get a
                    strong brand name that will help you succeed! It's quick, simple, and costs a
                    fraction of an agency. </p>

                    <p>You will start receiving name ideas - created specifically for you - within
                        minutes. Dozens of contestants work for you at the same time! A typical naming
                        contest receives several hundred name ideas. All ideas are automatically checked
                        for URL availability.

                        private
                        comments, and send public messages, leading the process towards the perfect

                        domain
                        checks, trademark risk assessment, linguistics analysis, and professional

                        back to
                        Squadhelp to launch a Logo Design or Tagline project for your name.</p>

                    <h4>Why should I use Squadhelp?</h4>
                    <p>You always have an option of hiring a consultant or coming up with the name
                        yourself. However, Squadhelp builds great brands that succeed faster by
                        connecting you with the most creative people across the globe. Most
                        importantly,
                        Squadhelp provides you with choice: you get to see ideas from dozens (in
                        some
                        cases, hundreds) of contestants before you select a winner. Typically, you
                        would
                        spend far less money with Squadhelp (our contests start at $199) than hiring
                        an
                        agency. Also, you will receive immediate results - most contests begin
                        receiving
                        submissions within minutes of starting.</p>
